title: using functoools to generate new functions from existing ones!

Lets start with a very basic example which demonstrates why we might need `functools.partial` in the first place, then we will look into a more concrete example.

we have a power function which is used to compute `powers` obviously ;)
{% highlight python %}

def power(base, exponent):
    return base ** power

>>> power(2,3)
8
>>>power(3,3)
27

{% endhighlight %}

Now suppose we want to introduce some custome functions which make use of `power` function
{% highlight python %}

def square(base):
    return power(base,2)

def cube(base):
    return power(base,3)

# and lots more similar function definations

{% endhighlight %}

In all the above cases we can see that the new function is generated by utillising the older funciton by just pre-determining one argument. in case of `square()` <b>2</b> is fixed while in case of `cube()` <b>3</b> is fixed.

Can we can do something better to achieve the same functionality as above? Yes!

lets see how.

{% highlight python %}

def power(base, exponent):
    return base ** power


square = functools.partial(power, exp=2)
cube = functools.partial(power,exp=3)


>>>print square(5)
25
>>>print cube(1)
1
{% endhighlight %}

using `functools.partial` we were able to create new functions from existing one! :)
